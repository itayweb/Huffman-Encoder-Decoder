# Huffman Encoder/Decoder
This is a mini project after learning about data compression, one in particular - Huffman encoding/decoding method

## The Program
This program (Console Application) takes a general text file with text in it and compress it into a byte array (long line of 1s and 0s) and dump it into a custom file, a `.huff` file.
And then decode back to a general text file.
